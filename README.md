# MathPrograms
Open Source Repo for Assignment 3  This Repository is Open Source. You will help create different programs using any language you see fit for mathematical equations. Such mathematical equations include volume or a sphere or volume of a cylinder. This a great way to practice or brush up on your programming skills!

Feel free to contribute! The languages that I would like to see being used to create some math programs are C++, C, Python, and Java. 

To contribute make sure to fork the repository, clone it, and then work on the issues. Then submit a pull request. Please comment on which issue you will be working on.
